# Angular Crashcoruse
The project is set up with NX (which is a wrapper around any WebApp)

Execute following actions to get started 

```sh
# ensure that npm is installed 
npm --version
node --version

# if not, install npm :) I am using Node v20.17.0 -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager

npm install
```

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve AngularCrashcourse
```

## IDE integration
If you use WebStorm I recommend using the NX Plugin for it (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15000-nx-console-ui)
